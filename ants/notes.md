Ants and Bees both have the attributes armor, damage, and place and the methods reduce_armor and action.

In a turn, The bee stings the ant in its place or moves to the next place if there is no ant in its place.

When any bee reaches the end of the tunnel or when the Queen Ant is killed, you lose the game.

Note that initializing an Ant here doesn't cost food, only deploying an Ant in the game simulation does.

The ThrowerAnt finds the nearest place in front of its own place that has Bees and throws at a random Bee in that place
